# Elevator Simulation

This project is a simplified elevator simulation implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create a specified number of floors and elevators, and then interact with the elevator system by requesting lifts to different floors.

## Features

- Dynamically generate floor buttons and elevator containers based on user input.
- Request a lift to a specific floor, and the closest available elevator will respond.
- Simulate elevator movement by updating elevator positions using a simple animation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshikas21/Elevator.git
cd elevator-simulation

## How it works

-Open the index.html file in your web browser.
-Enter the number of floors and elevators you want to simulate.
-Click the "Create" button to generate the floors and elevator containers.
-Click on a floor button to request a lift to that floor. The closest available elevator will respond and simulate movement.
